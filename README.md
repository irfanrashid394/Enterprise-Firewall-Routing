# Enterprise Firewall Routing & Redistribution  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on **secure firewall-based routing** and **route redistribution** across different protocols (**RIP, OSPF, EIGRP**). It includes **NAT configurations**, **ACL-based traffic filtering**, and **security enhancements** to control network access and optimize route advertisements.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- **Firewall Configuration** â€“ Security levels & interface setup  
- **Routing Protocols** â€“ RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP integration  
- **Route Redistribution** â€“ Controlled exchange of routes between protocols  
- **Access Control** â€“ Filtering using ACLs and route-maps  
- **NAT Implementation** â€“ Dynamic & Identity NAT for traffic control  

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture Overview  
- **Firewall as a Core Routing Device**  
- **Multiple Network Segments (Inside, DMZ, Outside)**  
- **Secured Inter-VLAN & Inter-Protocol Communication**  

## ðŸ”¹ Documentation  
The full **draft documentation** includes detailed implementation steps, configurations, and troubleshooting.  

## ðŸ”¹Getting Started
Refer to the draft documentation for setup instructions.
Deploy configurations on Cisco firewall and routers.

## Use Cases
âœ” Enterprise Firewall Security & Routing
âœ” ISP & Data Center Network Segmentation
âœ” Secure Multi-Protocol Routing with Redistribution

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ BGP Integration for scalable WAN routing
ðŸ”¹ Next-Gen Firewall Policies for advanced security
ðŸ”¹ Traffic Engineering using QoS & Policy-Based Routing
